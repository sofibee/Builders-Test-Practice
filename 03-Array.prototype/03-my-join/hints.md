#### Hint-1: Concatenating Strings

You can use the `+` operator to concatenate two strings together. For example, `'Fullstack' + ' Academy'` will produce the string `'Fullstack Academy'` . Remember though that this will not mutate or reassign either string! If you want to keep the output of the string concatenation, you will need to assign the value to a variable.
