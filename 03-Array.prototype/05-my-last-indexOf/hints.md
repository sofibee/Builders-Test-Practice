#### **Hint-1: Starting Point**

The `lastOfIndex([1,2,3,2,4],2)` function finds the **last** occurrence of the 2nd argument (the value to search). Since you are looking for the last occurrence, begin your search from the last index of the array. If there are three arguments, the last arguments indicates where to start your search. Start your search from third argument (if it is available) and work your way to the zeroth index (start) of the array.
