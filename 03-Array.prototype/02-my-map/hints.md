#### **Hint-1: Higher Order Functions**

In JavaScript, function are "first class" objects. This means you can use a function object the same way as you would use any other object or value! This is exciting, because it means that we can **pass functions into other functions and also return functions**. We call functions that can take functions as arguments or return a function  "higher order function".

#### **Hint-2: Understanding Map**

In many programming languages, to **map** means to apply a given function to each element of a list or array, returning a list of results in the same order. In order to understand and reproduce JavaScript's `map` function completely, make sure you check out the `map` [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map).
