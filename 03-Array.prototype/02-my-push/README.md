## myPush

Write the function `myPush` which mirrors the behavior of JavaScripts `.push()` array method.  

`myPush` should accept the array to operate on as an argument and return the new array with the added element.

`myPush` will receive two arguments: the array, and a single value to the added to the end of the array.

Do not use the native `.push()` method in your function!

#### Example


- INPUT: `myPush([1, 2, 3], 4);`
- OUTPUT: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
