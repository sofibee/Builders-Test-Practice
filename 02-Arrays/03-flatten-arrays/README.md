##flattenArrays


Write a function, flatten, that accepts a two-dimensional array as its argument and returns a flattened one-dimensional copy of the array.  

The argument array will never be more than 2 levels deep.  Remember to return a copy, meaning you should not modify the original 2D array passed in!

####Examples

- INPUT: `flatten([1,[2,3],4]);`
- OUTPUT: `[1,2,3,4];`
