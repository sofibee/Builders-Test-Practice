## 02-Array

Each problem in the "arrays" problem set have to do with manipulating a string (or turning a value into an array). Read each `README.md` file to get an overview of the problem.  After you have an understanding of the problem, work through the test specs.

There may be hints in the `README.md`, use them only if you are stuck.
