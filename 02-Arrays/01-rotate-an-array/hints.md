#### Hint-1: Array Methods

There are various ways to manipulate an array. Two useful methods, especially for this problem is the `[1,2,3].pop()` (removes the last value in the array) and the `[2,3].unshift(1)` (adds a value to the front of the array) methods. Review their documentation and try to find a way to use them in your solution (keep in mind, you don't HAVE to use them).
