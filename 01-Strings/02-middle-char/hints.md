#### Hint 1 - Even or Odd?

It is beneficial to know how to determine if a number is even or odd. One popular
way of determining if a number is odd or even is to create an expression
using the modulu (remainder) operator.

Ex:

```js

5 % 2 === 0; // false

4 % 2 === 0; // even

```

#### Hint 2 - Rounding Numbers

There are a few methods built-in on the `Math` object in javascript that help round numbers. 
It is useful to work with a whole number when using a number for an index position in a string. EX:
`'hello'[1]`.  Here are a few methods that may be useful for rounding.
