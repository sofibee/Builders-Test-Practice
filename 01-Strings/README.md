## 01-Strings

Each problem in the "strings" problem set have to do with manipulating a string (or turning a value into a string). Read each `README.md` file to get an overview of the problem.  After you have an understanding of the problem, work through the test specs.

There may be hints in the `README.md`, use them only if you are stuck.
